# Hi there, I’m Sean 👋

I’m a cybersecurity engineer and a builder. I like turning problems into secure, working systems. I’m exploring privacy-minded AI that makes internal knowledge actually useful.

👨‍💻 Day job: ship reliable, compliant, security-first solutions; reduce toil with sensible automation

🛠️ Builder: founder of EcommBeam (early)—local-/tenant-first AI that helps teams get answers and weekly clarity from their own docs

🤝 I care about measurable impact, clean handoffs, and security that enables growth

 Outside of working, I enjoy traveling, sports, and meeting cool people

## What I’m into

Cyber + software + ops glue (detections, dashboards, automation)

Local-first / private-tenant AI, workflow “nodes,” and lightweight connectors

Clean docs, small tools, and boring automation that teams actually use

## 2025 goals

Build & iterate (privately) on EcommBeam

Keep security fundamentals sharp

Stay healthy, ship consistently, and help others do the same
